first run these 2 commands in the terminal
npm install -D tailwindcss (do this only whenn the node package is initialized)
npx tailwindcss init

add this in the index.css 
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
 for the above three steps it will be error go to settings and search by ctrl + , and search unkown ignore it

open the file tailwind.config.js in the project and replace the content with this:
    content: [
    "place the path of the main file here",  // Ensure this matches the structure of your project
  ]
  config me ye bhi btana ha ka content kaha likh rahe ho 
  like this:
      content: [
    "./dist/index.html",  // Ensure this matches the structure of your project
  ],
  use * instead of the index it will be included to all the files

Run this command on the terminal"
  npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css
  -i means where is the input file present and -o where you need the output file the above output file contains alot of css in it and which css you need it includes into your html
  and after that you have to run the above command again

  for this use this command
        npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch

        when the above command is used there is no need to run again and again
